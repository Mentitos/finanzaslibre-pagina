# Instructions to view the responsive design changes

I have made the website responsive. To see the changes, you can start a simple web server from the project directory.

## 1. Start the server

If you have Python 3, run this command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m http.server
```

If you have Python 2, run this command:
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## 2. View the website

Then, open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see the website.
